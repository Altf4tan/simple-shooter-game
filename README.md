## About the Project

This project demonstrates the basics of creating a 2D game in Python using the [Arcade](https://api.arcade.academy/) library. Players control a spaceship, dodging and shooting asteroids that appear on the screen. Each asteroid destroyed increases the player's score.

### Features

- **Spaceship controls** for maneuvering and shooting.
- **Randomized asteroid movement** and spawning for a challenging experience.
- **Scoring system** based on the number of asteroids destroyed.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Arcade library

To install the Arcade library, run:

```bash
pip install arcade
```

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Asteroid-Smasher.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Asteroid-Smasher
   ```
3. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Play

Control your spaceship to shoot and destroy asteroids before they collide with you. Avoiding collisions is key to surviving and achieving a high score.

### Game Controls

- **Arrow Keys**:
  - **Up**: Thrust forward
  - **Left / Right**: Rotate spaceship
  - **Down**: Reverse thrust
- **Spacebar**: Shoot

### Scoring

Each asteroid destroyed adds to your score. The game ends when all lives are lost.
